    "Recall the definition of a rational number, denoted as $\\mathbb{Q}$. Prove that Euler's number $e = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$. A factorial is defined as $k! = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\\cdots$, $\\forall k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$, note that $0! = 1$. Furthermore, a sum notation $\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty k = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots$\n",

    "\\subsection*{Proof:}\n",
    "Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that Euler's number $e$ is rational. Then, $e$ can be expressed as $e = \\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers with no common factors other than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the series expansion of $e$:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "e = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!} = 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{2!} + \\frac{1}{3!} + \\frac{1}{4!} + \\ldots\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let $n$ be the smallest positive integer such that $\\frac{1}{n!} < \\frac{1}{b}$. Such an $n$ must exist since the factorial grows faster than any polynomial function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, consider the partial sum $S = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{1}{k!}$. Each term of $S$ is a positive rational number, and since rational numbers are closed under addition, $S$ is also a rational number.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, $S < e$ since $e$ is defined as the limit of the series, and $S = \\frac{a'}{b'}$ for some positive integers $a'$ and $b'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contradicts the fact that $e$ is the smallest upper bound of the partial sums, as $S$ is also an upper bound but smaller than $e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our assumption that $e$ is rational is false, and thus $e$ is irrational.\n",
