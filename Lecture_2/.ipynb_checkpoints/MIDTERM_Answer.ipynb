    "4. The trials are independent.\n",
    "5. The random variables of interest are $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_k$, where $Y_i$ equals the number of trials for which the outcome falls into cell $i$. Notice that $Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 + \\cdots + Y_k = n$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider the following experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The experiment consists of a fixed number, $n$, of identical trials.\n",
    "2. Each trial results in one of two outcomes: success, $S$, or failure, $F$.\n",
    "3. The probability of success on a single trial is equal to some value $p$ and remains the same from trial to trial. The probability of a failure is equal to $q = (1 - p)$.\n",
    "4. The trials are independent.\n",
    "5. The random variable of interest is $Y$, the number of successes observed during the $n$ trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: From the following steps shown above, derive the probability distribution of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 1: \n",
    "The probability distribution for the number of successes in a binomial experiment is given by the binomial distribution. The probability of observing exactly $y$ successes in $n$ trials is:\n",
    "$$P(Y = y) = \\binom{n}{y} p^y (1 - p)^{n - y}$$\n",
    "where $\\binom{n}{y}$ is the binomial coefficient:\n",
    "$$\\binom{n}{y} = \\frac{n!}{y! (n - y)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: Show that the expectation of this probability distribution is $E[Y] = \\sum y \\cdot P(Y = y) = np$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 2: \n",
    "The expected value of a binomially distributed random variable $Y$ with parameters $n$ and $p$ is:\n",
    "$$E[Y] = \\sum_{y = 0}^n y \\cdot P(Y = y)$$\n",
    "Using the binomial distribution, we have:\n",
    "$$E[Y] = \\sum_{y = 0}^n y \\cdot \\binom{n}{y} p^y (1 - p)^{n - y}$$\n",
    "This simplifies to:\n",
    "$$E[Y] = np$$\n",
    "This result can be derived using the linearity of expectation and the fact that each trial is independent and identically distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: Experience has shown that 30% of all persons afflicted by a certain illness recover. A drug company has developed a new medication. Ten people with the illness were selected at random and received the medication; nine recovered shortly thereafter. Suppose that the medication was absolutely worthless. What is the probability that at least nine of ten receiving the medication will recover?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 3: \n",
    "If the medication is worthless, the probability of recovery remains $p = 0.3$. We need to find the probability of observing at least nine recoveries out of ten:\n",
    "$$P(Y \\geq 9) = P(Y = 9) + P(Y = 10)$$\n",
    "Using the binomial distribution:\n",
    "$$P(Y = 9) = \\binom{10}{9} (0.3)^9 (0.7)^1 = 10 \\cdot (0.3)^9 \\cdot 0.7$$\n",
    "$$P(Y = 10) = \\binom{10}{10} (0.3)^{10} (0.7)^0 = (0.3)^{10}$$\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "$$P(Y \\geq 9) = 10 \\cdot (0.3)^9 \\cdot 0.7 + (0.3)^{10}$$\n",

    "Question 4: Suppose that a lot of 5000 electrical fuses contains 5% defectives. If a sample of 5 fuses is tested, find the probability of observing at least one defective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 4: \n",
    "The probability of observing at least one defective fuse in a sample of 5 can be found using the binomial distribution with $p = 0.05$ and $n = 5$.\n",
    "We first find the probability of observing no defectives:\n",
    "$$P(Y = 0) = \\binom{5}{0} (0.05)^0 (0.95)^5 = (0.95)^5$$\n",
    "The probability of observing at least one defective is:\n",
    "$$P(Y \\geq 1) = 1 - P(Y = 0) = 1 - (0.95)^5$$\n",
    "Calculating this, we get:\n",
    "$$P(Y \\geq 1) \\approx 0.2262$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the probability of observing at least one defective fuse is approximately $0.2262$.\n",

    "Question 1: Find a general formula for the expected value of this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 1:\n",
    "The given probability distribution is the Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda$. The expected value $E[Y]$ of a Poisson-distributed random variable $Y$ with parameter $\\lambda$ is given by $\\lambda$. \n",

    "$$E[Y] = \\sum_{y=0}^{\\infty} y \\cdot p(y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute $p(y)$:\n",
    "$$E[Y] = \\sum_{y=0}^{\\infty} y \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda^y}{y!} e^{-\\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite the summation starting from $y=1$ (since the term for $y=0$ is zero):\n",
    "$$E[Y] = \\sum_{y=1}^{\\infty} y \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda^y}{y!} e^{-\\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplify the $y$ term:\n",
    "$$E[Y] = \\sum_{y=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^y}{(y-1)!} e^{-\\lambda} \\cdot \\frac{1}{y} \\cdot y$$\n",
    "$$E[Y] = \\sum_{y=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^y}{(y-1)!} e^{-\\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $k = y - 1$, then $y = k + 1$:\n",
    "$$E[Y] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^{k+1}}{k!} e^{-\\lambda}$$\n",
    "$$E[Y] = \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!} e^{-\\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognize the series as the expansion of $e^{\\lambda}$:\n",
    "$$E[Y] = \\lambda e^{\\lambda} \\cdot e^{-\\lambda}$$\n",
    "$$E[Y] = \\lambda$$\n",

    "Therefore, the expected value $E[Y]$ of a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda$ is $\\lambda$.\n",

    "Question 2: A certain type of tree has seedlings randomly dispersed in a large area, with the mean density of seedlings being approximately five per square yard. If a forester randomly locates ten 1-square-yard sampling regions in the area, find the probability that none of the regions will contain seedlings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 2:\n",
    "The mean number of seedlings per square yard is $\\lambda = 5$. We want to find the probability that none of the ten 1-square-yard sampling regions will contain seedlings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the regions are sampled independently, we use the Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = 5$ for each region. The probability that a single region contains zero seedlings is:\n",
    "$$P(Y = 0) = \\frac{5^0}{0!} e^{-5} = e^{-5}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For ten independent regions, the probability that all ten regions contain zero seedlings is:\n",
    "$$P(\\text{none of the regions contain seedlings}) = (e^{-5})^{10} = e^{-50}$$\n",
